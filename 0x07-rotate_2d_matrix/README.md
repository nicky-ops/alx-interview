# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
Implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

## Concepts Needed
### 1. Matrix Representation in Python
- Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
- Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

### 2. In-place Operations
- Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
- The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place

### 3. Matrix Transposition
- Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix(swapping rows and columns).
- Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

### 4. Reversing Rows in a Matrix
- Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.

### 5. Nested Loops
- Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
- Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
